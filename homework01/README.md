## Solution summary:
- base requirement (`yield`'s after each sorting iteration)
- bonus task with coroutines pool (number of coroutines is passed as a 1st command-line parameter)
- no memory leaks
- no global variables
- I decided to use 'merge sort' algorithm for sorting. So sorting complexity is `O(n * log(n))`
- Time constraints are satisfied
